# Dijkstra-s-Path-Finding-Visualizer
 A visualization tool for various pathfinding algorithms.
 
This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms guarantees the shortest path

A Search* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

Breath-first Search (unweighted): a great algorithm guarantees the shortest path
